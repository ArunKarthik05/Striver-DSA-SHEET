## States of a Transaction

1. **Active**: This is the initial state of a transaction. In this state, the transaction is actively executing its operations, such as reading or writing data from/to the database.

2. **Partially Committed**: After the transaction has executed all its operations successfully, it enters the partially committed state. In this state, the changes made by the transaction are not yet permanent but are held temporarily in a buffer. The transaction is waiting for a signal to proceed to the next state.

3. **Committed**: Once the transaction receives confirmation from the database management system that all its changes have been successfully applied to the database, it enters the committed state. In this state, the changes made by the transaction are permanent and cannot be undone. Other transactions can now see the changes made by this transaction.

4. **Failed**: If a transaction encounters an error during its execution and cannot proceed further, it enters the failed state. In this state, any changes made by the transaction are rolled back, and the database returns to its state before the transaction began.

5. **Aborted**: After a transaction has failed, it enters the aborted state. In this state, any changes made by the transaction are undone, and the transaction is terminated. The database returns to its state before the transaction began, and any locks held by the transaction are released.

## Interviewer Question

**Interviewer**: Suppose you're working on a critical financial application where data integrity is of utmost importance. Can you explain how you would handle a transaction that enters the failed state? What steps would you take to ensure that the database remains consistent?

**Answer to the Interviewer Question**:

In a critical financial application, ensuring data integrity is paramount, especially in the event of a transaction failure. If a transaction enters the failed state, it indicates that an error occurred during its execution, and the changes made by the transaction cannot be applied to the database. In such cases, I would implement error handling mechanisms to catch and handle exceptions gracefully. This could involve rolling back the transaction to its initial state, releasing any locks acquired by the transaction, and logging the error for further analysis. Additionally, I would notify the appropriate stakeholders or system administrators about the failed transaction to take necessary actions, such as investigating the cause of the failure and performing any required data cleanup. Finally, I would implement retry mechanisms or fallback strategies to ensure that critical operations can be retried or alternative paths can be taken to maintain the consistency of the database.
