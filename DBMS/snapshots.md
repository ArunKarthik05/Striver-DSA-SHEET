In the context of databases, a snapshot refers to a consistent view of the database taken at a specific point in time. It represents the state of the database at that moment, including all committed transactions up to that point. Snapshots are often used in concurrency control mechanisms to provide isolation for transactions and ensure consistency.

Here's a breakdown of how snapshots work:

1. **Consistent View**: A snapshot ensures that a transaction sees a consistent view of the database, regardless of concurrent updates or modifications made by other transactions. It prevents phenomena such as dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads by presenting a stable snapshot of the data.

2. **Isolation for Transactions**: When a transaction begins, it typically establishes a snapshot of the database, capturing the state of all data items at that point in time. The transaction then operates on this snapshot without being affected by changes made by other transactions that occur after the snapshot was taken.

3. **Read Consistency**: Snapshots provide read consistency by ensuring that all data accessed by a transaction remains unchanged throughout the transaction's execution. Even if other transactions commit updates or insertions, the transaction operating on the snapshot continues to see the original data as it was at the time the snapshot was taken.

4. **Concurrency Control**: Snapshots play a crucial role in concurrency control mechanisms such as snapshot isolation. By providing each transaction with its own consistent snapshot of the database, concurrency control ensures that transactions can execute concurrently without interfering with each other's operations.

5. **Snapshot Isolation Level**: Database systems often offer different isolation levels, such as read committed and repeatable read, which determine the visibility of data changes to concurrent transactions. Snapshot isolation provides a higher level of isolation by ensuring that each transaction operates on a snapshot of the database, eliminating the risk of data inconsistency.

Overall, snapshots in databases serve as a fundamental mechanism for ensuring transactional consistency and isolation in a concurrent environment, allowing multiple transactions to execute safely and effectively without compromising data integrity.
