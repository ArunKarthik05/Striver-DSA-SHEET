Explicit and implicit locks are two different approaches to managing locks in a database management system (DBMS) for concurrency control:

1. **Explicit Locks**:
   - **Definition**: Explicit locks, also known as manual locks or user-defined locks, are locks that are explicitly requested and managed by the application developer or the user. 
   - **Usage**: In explicit locking, the application code explicitly requests locks on specific resources (such as rows, tables, or pages) using lock commands provided by the DBMS (e.g., `LOCK TABLE`, `LOCK ROW`, `LOCK PAGE`).
   - **Control**: The application has fine-grained control over when and how locks are acquired, released, and managed. This gives developers flexibility but also requires careful management to prevent deadlocks and ensure data consistency.
   - **Example**: In a banking application, a transaction may explicitly lock a bank account before performing a balance transfer operation to ensure that no other transaction can access or modify the account until the transfer is complete.

2. **Implicit Locks**:
   - **Definition**: Implicit locks, also known as automatic locks or system-defined locks, are locks that are automatically acquired and managed by the DBMS without explicit instructions from the application code.
   - **Usage**: In implicit locking, the DBMS automatically acquires and releases locks as needed to enforce isolation levels and prevent conflicts between transactions. 
   - **Control**: The DBMS handles lock acquisition, release, and management transparently, without requiring explicit intervention from the application code. This simplifies application development but may limit flexibility in certain scenarios.
   - **Example**: In a transactional environment, when a transaction updates a row in a database table, the DBMS automatically acquires a lock on that row to prevent other transactions from modifying it concurrently. The lock is released when the transaction commits or rolls back.

Here's a comparison of the two approaches:

| Aspect            | Explicit Locks                              | Implicit Locks                                      |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Control**       | Application developer/user has control     | DBMS has control                                    |
| **Usage**         | Locks are explicitly requested and managed | Locks are automatically acquired and managed        |
| **Flexibility**   | Fine-grained control over lock management  | Simplified lock management                         |
| **Complexity**    | May increase complexity of application code | Simplifies application code                        |
| **Scalability**   | Requires careful management to prevent deadlocks and ensure consistency | DBMS handles lock management transparently          |

In practice, both explicit and implicit locks have their use cases, and the choice between them depends on factors such as the complexity of the application, performance requirements, and the desired level of control over concurrency. Many modern DBMSs offer a combination of both approaches, allowing developers to use explicit locks when necessary while relying on the DBMS to handle most locking automatically.
