## Step-by-Step Explanation of Website Loading Process

1. **Typing the URL**:
   - You type a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) into the address bar of your web browser. For example, "https://www.example.com".

2. **DNS Resolution**:
   - Your web browser checks its local DNS (Domain Name System) cache to see if it already has the IP address corresponding to the domain name (www.example.com). If it doesn't have the IP address cached, it sends a DNS query to a DNS resolver.
   - The DNS resolver then looks up the IP address associated with the domain name by querying DNS servers. It may recursively query multiple DNS servers until it finds the authoritative DNS server for the domain.
   - Once the IP address is obtained, it is returned to your web browser.

3. **Initiating a TCP Connection**:
   - Your web browser initiates a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection to the IP address obtained in the previous step. This involves a three-way handshake:
     - SYN: The browser sends a SYN (synchronize) packet to the server.
     - SYN-ACK: The server responds with a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledgment) packet.
     - ACK: The browser sends an ACK (acknowledgment) packet back to the server.

4. **HTTP Request**:
   - Once the TCP connection is established, your browser sends an HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request to the web server. This request includes information such as the type of request (GET, POST, etc.), headers, and any additional data required by the server.

5. **Server Processing**:
   - The web server receives the HTTP request and processes it. This may involve accessing files, executing scripts, querying databases, or any other necessary tasks to generate the response.

6. **HTTP Response**:
   - After processing the request, the web server sends an HTTP response back to your browser. This response includes a status code (indicating success or failure), headers (containing metadata about the response), and the response body (which typically contains HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, or other resources).

7. **Rendering the Page**:
   - Your web browser receives the HTTP response and begins to render the web page. It parses the HTML content, processes CSS stylesheets and JavaScript code, and fetches any additional resources referenced in the page (such as images, fonts, or scripts).

8. **Displaying the Page**:
   - Finally, your web browser renders the fully-loaded web page and displays it to you, the user. You can now interact with the website and its content.
