SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide secure communication over a computer network. It is commonly used to secure data transfers between web servers and browsers, but it can also be used for other applications such as email, file transfer, and virtual private networks (VPNs). Here's an overview of SSL and its key features:

1. **Encryption**: SSL encrypts data transmitted between a client and server, ensuring that it cannot be intercepted and read by unauthorized parties. It uses cryptographic algorithms to scramble the data into an unreadable format, which can only be decrypted by the intended recipient.

2. **Authentication**: SSL provides mechanisms for verifying the identities of the communicating parties. This helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker intercepts and modifies communication between the client and server. SSL certificates, issued by trusted certificate authorities (CAs), are used to authenticate the identities of servers and, optionally, clients.

3. **Integrity**: SSL ensures the integrity of data transmitted between the client and server, detecting any unauthorized changes or tampering. It achieves this by using cryptographic hash functions to generate message digests, which are included in the transmitted data and verified by the recipient.

4. **Trust**: SSL relies on a hierarchical trust model, where certificate authorities (CAs) issue digital certificates to entities such as websites and organizations. Web browsers and other SSL-enabled clients come pre-installed with a list of trusted root certificates from well-known CAs. When a client connects to a server over SSL, it verifies the server's certificate against the trusted root certificates to establish trust.

5. **Versions and Successors**: SSL has evolved over time, with newer versions addressing vulnerabilities and adding features. SSL 3.0 was the first widely adopted version, followed by TLS (Transport Layer Security) 1.0, which was based on SSL 3.0. TLS has since undergone several revisions, with TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 being the most recent versions. TLS 1.3 offers improved security and performance compared to earlier versions.

Overall, SSL/TLS plays a crucial role in securing sensitive information transmitted over the internet, ensuring confidentiality, authentication, integrity, and trust.

**Interview Question:**
Imagine you're tasked with implementing SSL/TLS for a web server hosting an e-commerce website. How would you go about obtaining and installing an SSL certificate for the server, and what steps would you take to ensure that the SSL/TLS configuration is properly configured for secure communication with clients?
